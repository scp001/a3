    <h3>Hello Splat!</h3>
    <p>
	Your solution should be more inventive, including:
	<ul>
	    <li>text describing the great features of your app and team
	    <li>images of your team or something else to inspire readers
	</ul>
    <p>
	The About view doesn't have to be elaborate,
	but should at least include some motivational
	info about the app and development team (can be fabricated).
